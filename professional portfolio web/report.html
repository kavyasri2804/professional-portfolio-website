    <h1>Report</h1>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> S Kavyasri</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      My portfolio tells the story of a dedicated and innovative software
      developer with a passion for creating a variety of projects. It reflects
      my journey of continuous learning and problem-solving, where each project
      showcases the skills and technologies I've mastered. This portfolio is
      designed to highlight my expertise in web development, programming
      languages, and software engineering, while also emphasising my ability to
      work on both the technical and creative aspects of development.
      Furthermore, it also talks a little about who I am outside of work such as
      being a certified personal trainer with a passion for staying active.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm addressing an audience of potential employers, collaborators, and
      clients who are looking for a developer that can bring ideas to life
      through clean, scalable code and intuitive user interfaces. My target
      audience includes startups, tech companies, and individuals seeking
      professional-grade software solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure I chose for this portfolio is clean, minimalistic, and easy
      to navigate, allowing visitors to quickly understand my skills, view my
      work, and get in touch. It's divided into sections that feature the home,
      about me, services, portfolio, and a contact page. This clear, functional
      layout mirrors my approach to software development—organised, purposeful,
      and focused on delivering results.
    </p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://anniebombanie.com/">Annie's Portfolio</a>: Annie's
      website inspired the simplicity and minimalism I wanted for my own
      portfolio. Her contact page, in particular, resonated with me for its
      clean and straightforward design. I also admired how her navigation bar,
      featuring sections like Home, About, Skills & Tools, and Work, highlighted
      with a different colour when hovered over. I incorporated a similar
      feature into my site, with slight modifications, especially in the “About”
      section, where I showcase my skills, awards, experience, education, and
      certifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://robbowen.digital/">Robb Bowen's Portfolio</a>: I was
      drawn to the layout of Robb's portfolio, especially the design of his home
      page. His use of text on the left and an image on the right inspired the
      structure of my own home page. I aimed to create a similarly clean, modern
      feel, adopting a minimalistic black background with a striking blue
      contrast to make key elements stand out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://aakash-sharma.netlify.app/">Aakash Sharma's Portfolio</a
      >: Aakash's services section perfectly aligned with the vision I had for
      mine. I appreciated how he structured it, with an icon, title, and concise
      description for each service. I used his layout as a base, making minor
      adjustments while keeping the core design intact to present my own
      services clearly and professionally.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>High Contrast and Scalable Text:</strong> The design includes
      high-contrast colour combinations of black and royal blue to ensure
      readability for users with low vision or colour blindness. Text is also
      scalable, which allows users to increase font size without breaking the
      layout, making it accessible for those with visual impairments or reading
      difficulties. This can be controlled via relative units like 'rem' for
      fonts and ensuring the layout adjusts fluidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> The entire site is fully navigable
      via keyboard, without requiring a mouse. Interactive elements such as
      buttons, links, and forms have clear focus states, which allows users to
      easily see where they are on the page. This benefits users with motor
      disabilities who may use keyboards or alternative input devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Screen Reader Compatibility:</strong> The website is designed with
      semantic HTML, ensuring proper use of elements like &lt;header&gt;,
      &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;. This allows screen readers
      to navigate the content easily and present it in a logical, understandable
      way for users with visual impairments. Additionally, all images have
      descriptive 'alt' attributes, providing meaningful context to users
      relying on screen readers.
    </p>

    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Intuitive Navigation:</strong> The website is designed with a
      clear, intuitive navigation bar that allows users to easily find key
      sections like Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, and Contact. Each page is
      accessible in just one or two clicks, making it easy for users to explore
      my content without confusion. Hover effects and active link indicators
      provide visual feedback, enhancing the overall user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> I ensured the site is fully
      responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across devices, from
      desktops to tablets and smartphones. The layout, images, and text adapt
      smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring usability for users
      regardless of the device they are using. The titles of pages on the
      navigation header will be moved into a menu button in a smaller screen
      size to enable for proper sizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Minimalist Layout:</strong> The site's clean, uncluttered layout
      helps visitors focus on the content without distractions. By keeping the
      design simple and focusing on the essentials, users can navigate without
      feeling overwhelmed by unnecessary elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Creating a Scroll-Up Button Function:</strong> I wanted to
      implement a scroll-up button that would appear when the user scrolls down
      the page, allowing them to quickly return to the top with a single click.
      I learned to use JavaScript to detect the user's scroll position by
      listening for the 'scroll' event. Using conditional logic, I showed or hid
      the scroll-up button based on how far the user scrolled. I also applied
      smooth scrolling functionality using the scrollTo method to make the
      transition back to the top more fluid. Tutorials and documentation on
      JavaScript scroll function from w3schools website and YouTube helped me
      implement this feature effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Responsive Web Design:</strong> Creating a website that looks good
      and functions well across different devices required an understanding of
      responsive design principles. I learned how to use media queries in CSS to
      adjust the layout and content for various screen sizes. I also leveraged
      flexbox and grid layouts to make the site flexible and adaptable. Testing
      the website using the developer tools with the responsive dimensions
      helped me fine-tune the responsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Contact Form Submissions:</strong> I needed to create a functional
      contact form that could send emails directly from my website. I explored
      using the service 'EmailJS', which allows form submissions without
      requiring a back-end server. After integrating this, I tested the form for
      responsiveness and functionality. Reading the documentation for these
      third-party services helped me learn how to process form submissions
      securely and efficiently. Furthermore, I also watched YouTube tutorials to
      help me with the creation of the form.
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Clean and Intuitive Navigation:</strong> The navigation bar, with
      its hover effects and clear structure, allows visitors to move between
      sections of the site easily. The hover effect adds an interactive element,
      enhancing the user experience while maintaining simplicity. Furthermore,
      the social media icons allow for easy access to my socials for users to
      get to know me. The navigation bar also contains a 'Let's Chat' button
      which leads them instantly to my contact page for them to send me an
      email. When used with different screen sizes, as it gets smaller, the
      pages will disappear and be placed under a menu button instead to allow
      for proper resizing. This helps make the site both functional and visually
      appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Visual Aesthetics:</strong> The overall design of the site,
      particularly the balance between the colour scheme and typography, stands
      out as a key strength. The minimalist layout with bold accents, such as
      the black background and contrasting blue, provides a professional feel
      while keeping it engaging. This colour scheme is consistent throughout all
      the pages where even in the 'portfolio' page, my projects have a hover
      effect that pops up the blue colour. This was inspired by other successful
      portfolios, and I feel that it reflects my personality and technical
      skills effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Incorporating a Light Mode Option:</strong> Currently, the site
      uses a dark colour scheme, which might not be ideal for all users or
      contexts. Some visitors may prefer a light mode, especially during
      daylight hours or in brightly lit environments. Adding a light mode option
      that users can toggle would make the site more versatile and accessible to
      a wider audience. This can be achieved by using CSS custom properties
      (variables) to define colour schemes and switching between them with a
      simple JavaScript function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>More Engaging Content:</strong> While the portfolio section
      showcases the projects I've worked on, I could improve on the other
      sections such as the 'About' and 'Services' pages. They can be more
      engaging and informative to better capture and hold the user's attention.
      I would incorporate more interactive elements like infographics, videos,
      or case studies to make the content more dynamic. Ensuring that the
      content is updated regularly with fresh and relevant information would
      also improve engagement.
